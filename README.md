‚öΩ Scoring the Future: Predicting FC Barcelona Football Matches with XGBoost and Random Forest

üìö Research Summary
This repository presents the project and research paper:
"Scoring the Future: XGBoost for Predictive Analysis of FC Barcelona Matches"
Conducted by Harsh Dipdatt Patil, Ved Niteen Raut, and Anurag Das under Dr. Vishwanath Karad MIT World Peace University, Pune, India.

The project explores the application of machine learning models (Random Forest & XGBoost) to predict the outcomes of FC Barcelona's football matches (Win / Draw / Loss) based on a self-curated dataset from the 2023/24 and 2024/25 seasons.


üèÜ Key Highlights
Focus: Predict match outcomes for a single club (FC Barcelona) rather than general football prediction.

Models Used: Random Forest Classifier & XGBoost Classifier

Dataset: Manually created using statistics from fbref.com, focused solely on Barcelona‚Äôs matches.

Accuracy Achieved: 72.22% on test set

Research Paper: Included in this repository as final Fc Barca Research paper2.pdf
